üöÄ Getting Started: Running the Project Locally
There are two ways to run this project. The recommended method is using Docker, which is the fastest and most reliable way to get started.
Prerequisites
Docker Desktop installed and running on your system.
A local or remote MySQL database instance.
Method 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)
This method uses the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub, bypassing all local setup and dependency issues.
1. Clone the Repository (Optional, for reference)
If you want to see the code, you can clone it, but it's not required to run the Docker image.
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/RNKbansal23/Skill_Sync.git
cd Skill_Sync
2. Ensure Your MySQL Database is Running
Make sure your local MySQL server is active and you know the connection details (username, password, database name).
3. Run the Docker Container
Open your terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or VS Code terminal) and run the following command.
Important: You must provide your database connection details and a JWT secret as environment variables directly in the command.
code
Bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  --name skillsync-app \
  -e "DATABASE_URL=mysql://USER:PASSWORD@host.docker.internal:3306/DATABASE_NAME" \
  -e "JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_STRING" \
  aineshsridhar/synergy-platform:latest
Explanation of the command:
-p 3000:3000: Connects port 3000 of your computer to port 3000 inside the container.
--name skillsync-app: Gives the running container a convenient name.
-e "DATABASE_URL=...": Crucially injects the database URL.
Replace USER, PASSWORD, and DATABASE_NAME with your actual MySQL credentials.
host.docker.internal is a special DNS name that lets the container connect to your host machine's database.
-e "JWT_SECRET=...": Injects a secret key for signing authentication tokens.
aineshsridhar/synergy-platform:latest: The name of the Docker image to download and run.
4. Run Database Migrations
The container is running, but the database is empty. You need to create the tables.
code
Bash
# First, find the ID of your running container
docker ps

# Then, execute the migration command inside the container
docker exec <CONTAINER_ID> npx prisma migrate deploy
(Replace <CONTAINER_ID> with the ID you found from docker ps)
5. Access the Application
Your application is now fully running! Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000
Method 2: Running from Source (For Development)
Use this method if you want to make changes to the code.
1. Clone the Repository
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/RNKbansal23/Skill_Sync.git
cd Skill_Sync
2. Install Dependencies
code
Bash
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root of the project and add the following variables:
code
Env
# Your local database connection string
DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:3306/DATABASE_NAME"

# A secret key for JWT
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_STRING"
4. Run Database Migrations
This will apply the schema to your local database.
code
Bash
npx prisma migrate dev
5. Start the Development Server
code
Bash
npm run dev
6. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000

**
‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment**
